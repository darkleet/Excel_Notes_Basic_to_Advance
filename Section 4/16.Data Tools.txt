1.Data Sort
=>This is a tool which arranges our data into a meaningful order.
=>If we have text then it can arrange in alphabetic and reverse alphabetic order as well.
=>And for numbers they can be arranged in ascending and descending order.
Process :
=>For sorting first select column then we can click on filter and sort option which we can find in Home as well as Data menu.
=>For sorting of marks of students or anything else click on expand the selection else we will face problems like
marks of one student being assigned to another student.
=>For sorting marks of students in different subjects we will use the custom sorting and we will add the columns in which we want sorting.

2.Filtering
=>Like for e.g. we have gender data and we only want to see Female data then we can apply filter and can see Female
data.
Process :
=>For Filtering firstly select the table in which we want to apply filter.
=>Next we can do Filtering by going to Sort and filter option in Home bar above or by pressing Alt+A+T keyboard shrtcut.
=>Also in table we get an drop down options from which we can select and deselect particular fields inside of those columns too.
=>For seeing that on which column filter is placed we can see by seeing the symbol of drop-down is changed to filter symbol.
=>Also inside of the dropdown menu we can get many different option for Filtering numerical and text data accordingly.
=>If any column contains both numbers and alphabets then we can assign custom filter on it . and also for condition in 
numbers and text data we can apply custom filter.


3.Data Validations
=>This tool helps us from entering wrong data into the sheet.
Process :
=>For using this tool firstly select the column then go to data menu and then select Data Validation.
=>This can be used for purposes like when we have to enter marks or any data which is in range we can put that range
in this tool and select whole number and the tool will help us not enter value greater or less than it and will give us error.
=>Also this tool can be used for list Validation if we have a fixed list of data.
=>Also we can use this tool in order to have a max length for data i.e. if we want to have any character not more than 10 letter then we can do it using 
this tool.
=>There are two more tabs in Data Validation option in which we can customize for more uses,input and error message tabs
=>THis tabs show according to their names i.e. when user enters input then the message of input tab is seen and when user
does an error then message of error tab is seen.

/*IMP. DATA*/
4.Text to columns
=>Mostly when we scrape data it is seperated by comma or any other element/symbol.
Process :
=>So while working in EXCEL we want this data to be arranged in columns ,and this can be done easily by first selecting
cell in which we have data then going to Data tab and click on Text to column option.
=>In it we will get two option :
1.Delimitted
=>This option is selected when the data we have put is seperated using a particular seperator like comma,etc.
2.Fixed Width
=>This option is used when we don't have seperator in the data and we know exact no. of characters a single column should have.


5.Remove Duplicates
=>It will remove Duplicates from our data.
=>We can remove Duplicates of two types from the data i.e. 1. Full data same duplicate and
 other 2.column specific in which we want only some data to be removed which  is duplicate.
Process :
=>firstly select data the goto data tab and select remove Duplicates option and also one thing to notice as the remove
headers option opens we can see in top left  that already a tick has been there on My data has headers so see and tick/untick
it accordingly as in our data we have column headers of maths,science,english,etc.. and next on working with data which has all column as duplicates
we will select all option and press ok.

Now working with data which has some column values same ,so firstly select the columns having same entries then goto data tab and select remove Duplicates option 
and work accordingly.
