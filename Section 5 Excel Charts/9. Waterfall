These charts are mainly used for basically maintaining/creating a chart which can post both positive and negative values.

Waterfall charts are used in financial analysis mainly for seeing how from profit and loss net value has been obtained.

IN excel 2016 and above version waterfall charts have been included and in below version we have to manually create them.

For creating it automatically just select data table and click on insert and then recommended charts and select waterfall from them.

Also in this automatically created chart we have to define/specify base value for it goto formatting option by right click and format plot area

and then select first bar and then goto charting option and select positive values one by one and then click on set as total.

NOw for creating waterfall chart manually:for that we need to select stacked column chart and plot in them this thing by giving no fill 
to some values.
