Firstly select the whole excel data next goto  insert menu and click on recommended charts.

We can also see different chart layout by going on insert menu and click on  Quick Layout.

Now we will learn creating different charts from scratch:
1.Bar and column charts

=>Column charts are mostly used to compare data between two discrete items.
=>For seeing more column chart we will go in insert menu and then we will click on an icon having column behind recommended
charts option.
For creating this clustered column chart:
=>THe easy way as discussed above is that Firstly select the whole excel data next goto  insert menu and click on icon having column behind recommended
charts option.
=>But in this way we will have problem when we add new data.

*So, we will use the second way:
First  goto insert menu and select a 2D column chart which will be fully blank.
Next as soon as we select a blank chart we get design and select data option.
So firstly we will click on select data option and then we will select data from the chart and we can get this selected
data option also by right click on chart area.
In select data we can see two options:
1.Legend entries:Here we will add those things which we need to plot,on clicking add in it we will first define series name i.e. heading
and inside values we will add the values by selecting particular value cells.

2.and in horizontal entries we will add months cells according to current cells.

Two things are missing in our charts now:
1.Chart title
2.Legend box which tells us the color of chart relates to which data. 

So we can add them by clicking on + sign on top left of chart.


Now creation of stack column chart:
By selecting our chart and clicking on stack column chart inside of insert menu bar.
Some people use 3D bars for showing their charts but mostly 2D bar charts are preffered.


And we can also created clustered bar and stack bar charts which are used when the bottom horizontal value/text is big so it is easy in 
bar chart to represent them.
