Pie Chart is useful when we want to show relative proportion or contributions from a particular data.

Pie chart can only use a single data series.
It is useful in representing 5-6 data points.

If we want data in percentages we can do by data format and then in data series formatting we can change.

Also if we want to do data explode i.e. we want to highlight any particular slice then we can do by double clicking on it 
and then drag and drop.


#We can also create a pie of pie or bar of pie chart which will show us the value of any particular slice in other 
pie or bar chart.
 
 In bar chart we have every subcategory contribution in the height of the bar.It is in form of a stack bar column.And remember to add data
 labels in every chart.


 In pie chart we have last option for doughnut chart and it is similar to pie chart but the major two difference in it is that it has hole in 
 middle and it can show 1 to more data series in its chart.

For increasing the ring size decrease the doughnut hole size.
But this type of chart is very less used.
