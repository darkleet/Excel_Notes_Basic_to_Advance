Scatter Plot is also called as XY charts.

These charts show values on both axis i.e. X and Y axis.Mostly these charts are used to show relationship between
two variables.

If we want to show absolute value start axis from 0.
and if we want to show relative values then we can start from any other value  and for that right click on Y axis and 
format data and then in bounds put the minimum value from where to start.

Types of Scatter Plot Charts:
Scatter Plot with smooth lines can be used to show that how values are changed in series.

Also we have another same Scatter Plot with smooth lines with no data markers where we can see that there are no circles
on data points

Major work of Scatter Plot is to find relationship between X and Y axis.
Firstly we can find it by manual analysis.
Second we can do is by drawing a trendline. And it can be added in chart by using + symbol in chart
This trendline can be of any type i.e. Linear,Exponential,polynomial,etc.
And through this we can also have sales forecast.

And also if we want to have an equation of the X and Y axis that we can do by going inside format data of trend line
and clicking on display equation of chart.


For getting relationship b/w two variables we use Scatter Plot but for three variables we use bubble plot chart.
