Difference between RANK, RANK.AVG and RANK.EQ
There are three versions of the RANK formula that you can use in MS Excel

RANK was available in the older versions of excel. We can still use it; probably, it will not be available in the coming versions of Excel. There are two new versions of rank now - RANK.EQ and RANK.AVG. The below example may clarify the difference between these two -

For values 5,6,6,7 -RANK and RANK.EQ will return ranks as 1,2,2,4 (Same rank for same values) and RANK.AVG will return ranks as 1 ,2.5 ,2.5 ,4. (Average of 2nd and 3rd rank). Because of RANK.AVG takes the average of the ranks where values are the same; we often see decimal digits in ranks calculated using this formula.

If all the values in the list are unique, all the three formulas assign the same ranks in that case.
