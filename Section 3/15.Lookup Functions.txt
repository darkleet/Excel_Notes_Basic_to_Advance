VLOOKUP :
VLOOKUP function looks up a supplied value in the first column of the table,and returns the corresponding value from
another column.
Usage : VLOOKUP(LOOKUP_VALUE,TABLE_ARRAY,COLUMN_INDEX_NUM,[RANGE_LOOKUP])

IN FIRST PARAMETER TYPE THE THING FOR WHOSE WE WANT TO HAVE VALUE for e.g. maths subject.
IN FIRST PARAMETER TYPE THE THING FOR WHOSE WE WANT TO HAVE VALUE.
IN NEXT PARAMETER SELECT THE TABLE FROM WHERE WE WANT THE MATCH AND HAVE IT LOCKED IF YOU WANT MORE THAN ONE RESULT IN FUTURE.
IN NEXT PARAMETER WRITE THE INDEX NO.OF THE TABLE SELECTED IN PREVIOUS RANGE FROM WHICH column OF TABLE WE WANT TO HAVE VALUE.
AND THE LAST ONE IS FOR 0=>IF WE WANT PERFECT MATCH AND 1=>IF WE WANT ACCURATE MATCH.
$IMP$
=>IN VLOOKUP the reference column is always the first column where as in INDEX Match it is not necessary.

HLOOKUP :
HLOOKUP function looks up a supplied value in the first row of the table,and returns the corresponding value from
another row.
Usage : HLOOKUP(LOOKUP_VALUE,TABLE_ARRAY,COLUMN_INDEX_NUM,[RANGE_LOOKUP])

IN FIRST PARAMETER TYPE THE THING FOR WHOSE WE WANT TO HAVE VALUE for e.g. maths subject.
IN NEXT PARAMETER SELECT THE TABLE FROM WHERE WE WANT THE MATCH AND HAVE IT LOCKED IF YOU WANT MORE THAN ONE RESULT IN FUTURE.

INDEX :
Index function returns a reference to a cell that lies in a specified row and column of range of cells.
=>For this it is must to have either row_num or col_num.

Usage : INDEX(array,row_num,[col_num])
e.g. =INDEX(C4:E8,C10,D11)

MATCH :
Match function looks up a value in an array and returns the position of the  value within the array.

Usage:=Match(LOOKUP_VALUE,LOOKUP_array,[Match_type])
e.g. : =MATCH(C8,C3:C7,0)


INDEX-MATCH :
It is the older brother of the most used VLOOKUP.
It allows us to look up values in a table based off other rows & columns.
Mostly not used in small data sets.

$IMP$
=>IN VLOOKUP the reference column is always the first column where as in INDEX Match it is not necessary.

Usage :(range,match(LOOKUP_VALUE,LOOKUP_rangE,Match_type))
