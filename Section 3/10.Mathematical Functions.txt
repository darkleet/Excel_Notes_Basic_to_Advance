Difference between formulas and functions:
Formula:
Formula is an expression which calculates the value of a cell and it can be any expression.
e.g. A1+B1

Functions:
Function is a predefined formula and which can be automatically used by defining descriptive names.
In excel we use functions as they increase the productivity of the work.
e.g. sum(value1,value2,...) and as we press enter then we will get the sum of all numbers placed inside of sum function.

$TIP$:
As soon as we get function name in suggestion and we will press tab then it will autocomplete till first bracket and ask for values to be 
entered.


Now, Different function usage :
#sum():
1).Way 1 : sum(value1,value2,...) and as we press enter then we will get the sum of all numbers placed inside of sum function.

2).Way 2 : sum(cell1,cell2,...) and as we press enter then we will get the sum of all numbers placed inside of cells.

3).Way 3 : This is a type of range method in which we input the first and the last cell for in which full series summation will be done.

sum((start_cell)cell1:(end_cell)celln) and as we press enter then we will get the sum of all numbers in the range from start to end.

#min/max :
->This function returns the smallest number in a given set of values.
->This function returns the largest number in a given set of values.
->It ignores logical values and text.
min usage :
1)min((start_cell)cell1:(end_cell)celln) and as we press enter then we will get the minimum value of all numbers in the range from start to end.

max usage :
1)max((start_cell)cell1:(end_cell)celln) and as we press enter then we will get the maximum value of all numbers in the range from start to end.

#avg() :
->This function returns the average value of given numbers.
->It ignores text values and blank cells.
avg usage :
average((start_cell)cell1:(end_cell)celln) and as we press enter then we will get the average value of all numbers in the range from start to end.

#rank.avg() :
->If we want to give rank to person on basis of some parameters we can use this rank.avg function.

rank.avg Usage :
=rank.avg(first_parameter_should_be_the_number_whose_rank_is_to_be_founded (avg(in our case)),series_from_where_to_find_rank(),last_parameter_is_how_should_be_the_ranking_done(0->descending(If highest rank is 1 the third parameter should be zero),1-Ascending))
->One *imp* thing to be noted is that when we drag down this formula for finding ranks of other persons then the middle parameter of series gets
changed which is not a good thing then we have to use the concept of constant thing i.e. $.

$Tip2$
Also there is a shortcut for adding $ symbol to cell we have to press f4 on cell name inside of formula bar to add dollar symbol on both rows and 
column which is a good thing.

#Sum Product() :
->This formula returns sum after multiplying numbers in an array.
->It can also be used to count cells based on criteria provided.

general formula :
sumproduct(array1,array2,...)

#rand()  :
->This function returns values greater than 0 and less than 1.
->The number change on recalculations.
->It does not take any input values.
->Mostly used for chance events such as dice throwing, coin toss,etc. .

#randbetween :
->This function returns numbers between specified numbers.
e.g. randbetween(bottom,top).


$Imp.$
=>As soon as we are entering new values or pressing enter in any cell then the values of rand and randbetween cells keep changing so in 
order for them to keep the values as it is we will copy the values to a new cell and paste them in form of value only and then paste those 
values back again to the cells where they are needed thus now the values will not keep changing.

Formula to be done in HW :
1.MOB
2.ABS
3.ROUND
4.PI
5.SORT
6.LOG
