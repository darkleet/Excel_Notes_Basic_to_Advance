1.Trim :
This function removes spaces all before and following the words i.e. leading  and tailing spaces -and also removes 
extra spaces between words but does not remove the single space between two words.
e.g. trim(text/cell_name) and this will remove the extra space.

and after getting value keep in mind to past the value somewhere so that afterwards we can get only the value or else formula will
be there which will create a problem.

2.Concatenate :
This function joins several text string into one string.
e.g. Concatenate(string1,string2,...)
                or
e.g. Concatenate(string1&string2,...)

3.Substitute :
->This function is used to replace a part of text in a string with something else.
->SUBSTITUTE function is used to clean data.
->This function is case sensitive.

usage :
=Substitute(Text/cell_no.,old_text,new_text,[instance_number])
=>Here, the fourth parameter is optional and is called instance_number which means if a letter is repeated then which 
letter to take in replacement case.
like in word Stutent : (Stutent,"t","d",2(here as we wanted to take second t so written like this))
=>It is must to add double inverted commas while writing old_text and new_text.

$TIp$
if we want to show whole formula then we can show it by having space before equal_to(=) symbol in the cell.
e.g. (space) =SUBSTITUTE(A4,"science","english")


5.Upper and Lower
=>THis functions convert string to upper and lower cases.
Usage:
=upper(Text/cell_no.)
=lower(Text/cell_no.)

6.Length() :
=>THis function returns the number of characters in a string(text or numberic value).
=>It also counts the spaces and special characters.
Usage:
=len(Text/cell_no.)

7.Left,mid,Right :
=>This function mainly returns the number of specified characters from the start/end of the string.
=>"MID" returns the number of specified characters from a specified point.
USAGE :
=LEFT(TEXT,[num_characters])
=RIGHT(TEXT,[num_characters])
=MID(TEXT,[STARTING_POSITION],[num_characters])


ALSO we will get all textual functions in the formula menu of excel.
