For editing a formula we can edit it in formula bar or by double clicking on the cell.

As soon as we extend formulas to next row we get formulas are updated for next rows/columns.

If we want to add any constant value to a formula then we can do by adding a dollar symbol before row name.
e.g. A2+B2+B$13 will add constant value and will update other row and column values.

For column addition(i.e. Horizontal additon) of constant value to column we will add a dollar symbol before column name.
e.g. =I3+I4+$I6
